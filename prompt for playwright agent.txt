# Manual Testing Prompt: Draft a Test Plan for Login Functionality

## Objective
You are an AI agent tasked with drafting a comprehensive test plan for the login functionality of the following web application:

**URL:** https://practicetestautomation.com/practice-test-login/

## Instructions
1. Analyze the login page and its elements (username, password, submit button, error messages, etc.).
2. Identify and describe positive test cases (e.g., valid login, logout).
3. Identify and describe negative test cases (e.g., invalid username, invalid password, empty fields).
4. Specify expected results for each test case.
5. Include edge cases and usability considerations.
6. Structure your test plan clearly, using sections and bullet points.

## Output Format
- The test plan should be written in Markdown.
- Each test case should include:
  - Test Case Name
  - Steps
  - Expected Result

# Manual Test Cases Format Prompt

## Objective
Create manual test cases covering all scenarios in the manual-testing/test-plan.md. Each test case should be modular, clearly structured, and ensure that the objective is only met if all steps pass. The test cases should be stored in a file named `manual-testing/test-cases.md`.

## Instructions
- Each test case must include:
  - **Test Case Name**
  - **Objective**: What the test aims to validate.
  - **Pre-requisites**: Any setup or conditions required before executing the test.
  - **Test Steps**: Numbered steps, each with a corresponding expectation.
  - **Step Expectation**: What should happen after each step. If any expectation fails, the test fails.
  - **Final Result**: If all steps and expectations pass, the objective is met.

## Output Format
Write each test case in Markdown as follows:

---

### Test Case Name
- **Objective:** [Describe the goal of the test]
- **Pre-requisites:**
  - [List any required setup, data, or environment]
- **Test Steps & Expectations:**
  1. [Step 1]
     - **Expectation:** [Expected outcome for step 1]
  2. [Step 2]
     - **Expectation:** [Expected outcome for step 2]
  ...
- **Final Result:**
  - If all expectations are met, the objective is achieved.
  - If any expectation fails, the test fails.

---

## Coverage
Test cases should cover all scenarios defined in `test-plan.md`, including:
- Valid login
- Logout
- Invalid username/password
- Empty fields
- Edge cases (case sensitivity, whitespace)
- Usability (tab navigation, password masking, error message clarity)

## Example

### Valid Login
- **Objective:** Verify that a user can log in with valid credentials.
- **Pre-requisites:**
  - User has valid username and password.
  - Browser is on the login page.
- **Test Steps & Expectations:**
  1. Enter valid username.
     - **Expectation:** Username is accepted.
  2. Enter valid password.
     - **Expectation:** Password is accepted.
  3. Click "Submit".
     - **Expectation:** User is redirected to the secure area.
- **Final Result:**
  - If all expectations are met, user is successfully logged in.
  - If any expectation fails, the test fails.
